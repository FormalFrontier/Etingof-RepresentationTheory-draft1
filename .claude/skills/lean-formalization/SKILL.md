# Lean Formalization Skill

Patterns for formalizing mathematics textbooks into Lean 4 with Mathlib. Derived from Phase 2 analysis of 583 items across 10 chapters of Etingof's Representation Theory.

## Translation Pipeline

Formalizing an item follows three stages: **translate**, **scaffold**, **prove**.

### 1. Translate: Natural Language to Formal Statement

Read the item's blob text and its `.refs.md` file (Mathlib coverage + external sources). Then:

1. **Identify the Mathlib types.** Check `.refs.md` for exact/partial matches. For exact matches, use the Mathlib declaration directly. For partial matches, read the Mathlib source to understand the gap.
2. **State the theorem/definition.** Write the Lean signature with `sorry` as body. Include a docstring with the book's natural language statement.
3. **Check it compiles.** Run `lake env lean <file>` — fix import and type errors before proceeding.

**Common pitfalls:**
- Don't invent type classes. If Mathlib doesn't have a concept, use a `structure` or `def` with explicit fields.
- Don't use `True` as a placeholder for propositions — it compiles but hides the real requirement.
- Check that universe levels are consistent. Representation theory often needs `Type*` not `Type`.

### 2. Scaffold: Set Up the Proof Structure

Before attempting the proof:

1. **Read the book's proof sketch.** Identify the key steps and what facts they use.
2. **Check dependencies.** All items this proof depends on should be sorry-free (or admitted for now). If not, either work on those first or use `admit` temporarily.
3. **Outline the proof.** Use `sorry` for each major step:

```lean
theorem foo : statement := by
  -- Step 1: reduce to case X
  sorry
  -- Step 2: apply theorem Y
  sorry
  -- Step 3: algebraic manipulation
  sorry
```

### 3. Prove: Fill In Sorries One at a Time

Follow the global CLAUDE.md proof rules strictly:

1. **One tactic at a time.** Write one tactic, check diagnostics.
2. **Use `done` to see remaining goals.** Don't guess what the goal state is.
3. **Error priority:** syntax > type > unsolved goals > warnings.
4. **Stop at first error.** Don't continue writing tactics after an error.
5. **Hardest case first.** For case splits, sorry the easy cases and focus on the hard one.

### Tactic Selection Guide

| Goal Shape | Try First | Then Try |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| `⊢ a = b` (algebraic) | `ring`, `field_simp; ring` | `simp`, manual `rw` |
| `⊢ a = b` (categorical) | `simp [CategoryTheory...]` | `ext`, `aesop_cat` |
| `⊢ P ∧ Q` | `exact ⟨..., ...⟩` or `constructor` | split into subgoals |
| `⊢ ∃ x, P x` | `exact ⟨witness, proof⟩` | `use witness` |
| `⊢ P → Q` | `intro h` | `fun h => ...` |
| `⊢ ∀ x, P x` | `intro x` | lambda |
| Finite group theory | `decide` (small groups) | case analysis |
| Linear algebra | `ext`, `simp [LinearMap...]` | `apply LinearMap.ext` |
| Module homomorphisms | `ext`, `simp` | manual composition |

### Representation Theory Patterns

This book covers:
- **Chapters 1-3:** Basic algebra (associative algebras, quivers, Lie algebras)
- **Chapters 4-6:** Representation theory fundamentals (representations, characters, tensor products)
- **Chapters 7-10:** Advanced topics (structure theorems, categories, Hopf algebras)

**Key Mathlib imports for this book:**
```
Mathlib.Algebra.Algebra.Basic
Mathlib.RingTheory.TensorProduct.Basic
Mathlib.Representation.Basic
Mathlib.Algebra.Lie.Basic
Mathlib.Algebra.Category.ModuleCat.Basic
Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.TensorProduct.Basic
Mathlib.GroupTheory.GroupAction.Basic
```

**When Mathlib doesn't have it:** Check the `.refs.md` file for the item. If coverage is "gap", you need to build the definition from scratch. State it clearly, add a comment `-- not in Mathlib as of v4.28`, and use sorry for the proof.

## Aristotle Escalation

### When to Escalate

Escalate after **2-3 serious attempts** (not 2-3 minor variations of the same approach). A "serious attempt" means:
- You identified the mathematical strategy
- You got partway through (some subgoals resolved)
- You hit a specific blocker (missing lemma, type mismatch, tactic timeout)

### How to Escalate

1. **Prepare file.** Copy the item's `.lean` file. Keep exactly one `sorry` (the target). Change all other `sorry` to `admit`.
2. **Gather context.** Collect sorry-free local `.lean` files from the import chain. Skip Mathlib imports.
3. **Submit.**
   ```bash
   aristotle prove-from-file item_pending.lean --no-wait \
     --no-auto-add-imports --context-files dep1.lean dep2.lean
   ```
4. **Record in items.json.** Set status to `sent_to_aristotle` with the project ID.
5. **Delete temp file.** Never commit files with `admit`.

### After Aristotle Returns

- **Success:** Verify with `lake env lean`, copy proof, update status to `sorry_free`.
- **False statement:** Mark `attention_needed`, post GitHub issue with counterexample.
- **Failure/timeout:** Mark `attention_needed`, move on to next item.

## Quality Checks

Before submitting a PR for a formalized item:

1. **`lake env lean <file>` passes** — no errors
2. **No `sorry` remaining** in the target item (sorry in dependencies is OK)
3. **No `admit`** anywhere in committed code
4. **Docstring present** with book's natural language statement
5. **Imports are minimal** — only import what's actually used

## Issue Sizing for Formalization

Based on Phase 2 experience with issue sizing:

- **Definitions:** 1-3 per issue (fast, low risk)
- **Easy theorems** (direct application of Mathlib): 2-5 per issue
- **Medium theorems** (multi-step proofs): 1-2 per issue
- **Hard theorems** (may need Aristotle): 1 per issue
- **Never mix difficulty levels** in one issue — a hard theorem blocks the easy ones

## Common Failure Modes

From Phase 2 review patterns (50% attribution error rate in Stage 2.4 Part 1):

1. **Wrong Mathlib declaration name.** Always `#check` the declaration before using it.
2. **Fabricated references.** If `.refs.md` cites a Mathlib declaration, verify it exists.
3. **Scope mismatch.** The book may state a theorem for a specific case (e.g., finite-dimensional) but Mathlib has it more generally. Use the general version.
4. **Missing instances.** Representation theory needs many type class instances. If Lean can't find one, check if Mathlib has it under a different name or if you need to `open` a namespace.
