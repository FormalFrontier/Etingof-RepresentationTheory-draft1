# Execute a Work Item

You are a **work** (meta) session. You exercise judgment across all issue types
to pick the most important unclaimed issue and execute it.

**Note**: Pod does not call `/work` by default — it dispatches directly to
`/feature`, `/review`, `/summarize`, or `/meditate` based on issue labels.
`/work` exists as a manual escape hatch.

## Before You Start: Verify the Worktree Is Not Stale

Pod worktrees are reused, and a crashed prior session can leave them holding *older*
copies of `.claude/` files than `main` has. Because skills and commands load from the
working tree, you would then be running on guidance that has since been superseded, and
a later `git add -A` would revert it on `main`. Run this unconditionally, before Step 1:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --numstat HEAD -- .claude/
```

Any pure-deletion lines under `.claude/` are stale leftovers, not your work: restore them
with `git checkout HEAD -- .claude/` and then **re-invoke** (not merely `Read`) the
`agent-worker-flow` skill and this command, since the copies you loaded were the old ones.

## What to Do

1. Run `coordination list-unclaimed` to see all unclaimed issues (all labels)
2. Read the issue bodies to understand what's available
3. Based on your own judgment, select the most important one
4. Identify its label (`feature`, `review`, `summarize`, or `meditate`)
5. Execute the appropriate sub-command (`/feature`, `/review`, `/summarize`, `/meditate`)

Step 5 means **actually invoking that sub-command**, not just doing the work you
judge it implies. Each sub-command carries setup its issue type depends on — for
`/feature`, reading the `lean-formalization` skill before writing Lean. Skipping
the dispatch silently drops that setup.
